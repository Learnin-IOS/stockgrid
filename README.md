Inspired by The Apple Stock App, we created a package that us powerd by the Yahoo Finance API(https://github.com/Learnin-IOS/StocksAPI) to be used as a Data Layer for the amazing app/tool for quickly looking at your current stock price, and keeping track of stocks you own, would like to buy, and reading news about those stocks.
